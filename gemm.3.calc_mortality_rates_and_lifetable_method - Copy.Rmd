#> select the mortality dataset on which the rest of the analysis will be performed (after joining with relative risks). We have 2 options, one is the 5 COD mr data, the other is ncd + lri mr data. As a start, I have chosen the 5 cod data. Note that: if you need to perform analysis for the ncd + lri data, all you need to do is to replace the 5 cod mr data with the ncd+lri data in the line below and the rest of the analysis code remains the same.

     select(-cause_id.y) %>%
  rename(cause_id = cause_id.x)

#> dropping redundant columns and renaming certain columns after dropping the redundancies, then reordering the columns. Note that, it is possible that some of the function names for dplyr and plyr might clash. So, use the package prefix, before the function name. For example, to rename a column, use: dplyr::rename(), instead of just rename()
cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data <- cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data %>%
  dplyr::arrange(cause, age_interval_ll)

#> converting the above dataset back into long format, such that "pm_level" and "relative risk" are columns in the new dataset and sort the dataset by cause, pm_level, age_interval
cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long <- cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = relative_risk0:relative_risk121, names_to = c("pm_level"), names_pattern = "(\\d+)", values_to = "relative_risk") %>%
  arrange(cause, age_interval_ll, pm_level)

#> For all age groups less than 25 years of age, relative risks information is not availbale. For these, assume that relative risks = 1. Also replace any missing relative risks information with 1. Below code, replaces all those rows in the "relative_risk" column, where age_interval_ul < 25, with 1. Also, if relative risks data is missing, fill it in with relative risks = 1. 

cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long <- cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long %>%
  mutate(relative_risk = ifelse(age_interval_ul < 25, 1, relative_risk),

#> Find the pm_level in the "cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long" dataset that is closest to "global_average_pm2.5" that is set up top in "lib_glob_parameters" chunk.

#> pm2.5 buckets, one of which will contain the global_avg_pm2.5. This bucket will be the one that is closest to the global average PM2.5 value that is set up top. In old STATA scripts, you will find that this process is carried out by a "rounding process". But, that has to be adjusted every year the dataset changes. What I have done below is agnostic to any data changes.

# figure out the unique PM2.5 values in the data and sort them in ascending order
unique_list_of_pm2.5_val_in_data <- sort(unique(cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long$pm_level))

# calculate how far the global average pm2.5 value is from each of the values in the above list of unique pm2.5 values
distance_from_global_avg_pm2.5 <- abs(unique_list_of_pm2.5_val_in_data - global_avg_pm2.5)

# *New assumption in here*: Which pm_level value in our current dataset is the closest to the "global_average_pm2.5"? If there are 2 such values, choose the one with a lower pollution number, so that our estimate is a conservation one (for now)
potential_pm2.5_buckets_indices <- which(distance_from_global_avg_pm2.5 == min(distance_from_global_avg_pm2.5))

# if there are more than one potential buckets in which the global_average_pm2.5 can land, this conditional statement below chooses the bucket with a lower pm2.5 level. This is a conservative step that we take for now and will reevaluate its implications.
if(length(potential_pm2.5_buckets_indices) < 2){
  global_avg_pm2.5_rounded <- unique_list_of_pm2.5_val_in_data[potential_pm2.5_buckets_indices]
} else {
  global_avg_pm2.5_rounded <- min(unique_list_of_pm2.5_val_in_data[potential_pm2.5_buckets_indices])
}

#> create a new temp columm that will be used to create yet another "rr_normalizer" column which will be used to create yet another "adjusted_mortality_rates" column. After generating the "rr_normalizer" column, the "temp" column will be dropped as it would have served its purpose by then. The "temp" column in the step below takes in the relative risk number of those rows where pm_level = "global_avg_pm2.5_rounded" number. In other words, it takes on those relative risk numbers that correspond to the current global average pm2.5 concentration level.  

# create a new "temp" column
cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long <- cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long %>%
  mutate(temp = ifelse(pm_level == global_avg_pm2.5_rounded, relative_risk, NA))

# group by cause, and age_interval and each row of each of these groups, gets the relative risk number that is equal to mean of "temp" column for that group. Capture this new information in a new column called "rr_normalizer".
cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long <- cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long %>%
  group_by(cause, age_interval_ll) %>%
  mutate(rr_normalizer = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# drop the temp column
cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long <- cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long %>%
  select(-temp)

# add a new column called "adjusted mortality rate", which adjusts the mortality rate for a given age_cat, cause group, by their RR in relation to the RR at the rounded Global Average PM2.5. Here the assumption is that in the absence of the risk factor, age specific death rates would be proportionally lower. This dataset corresponds to the "file1" dataset in the STATA script. This is what "PM2.5 specific mortality rates" would be if PM2.5 = X. This helps us calcuate mortality rates for any given counterfactual PM2.5 value "X".

cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long <- cleaned_joined_gemm_mr_rr_analysis_data_long %>%
  mutate(adjusted_mortality_rate = (mortality_rate * relative_risk)/rr_normalizer)
