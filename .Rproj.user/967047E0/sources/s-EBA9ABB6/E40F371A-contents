## Cleaning the Mortality Rates file: Main Steps

* Load in the Mortality Rates raw csv file for `r gbd_year` as per the instructions in the **CodeOutlineREADME.docx** file, present at the root of this repo.
* Drop certain countries **(Why?)**: England, Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland.
* Rename certain columns in the files (and label variables)
  * val > mortal_rate
  * sex_name > sex, 
  * cause_name > cause
* remove the word "years" from the "age_name" column
* Drop certain rows:
  * **(Why?)**Where Age intervals is one of: Neonatal, [0, 1], [5, 14], [15, 49], [50, 69], [70, inf], [80, inf], [10, 24], [10, 54], [10, 19]. It looks like that from one year to the next, the `age_ids` to `age_name` mapping remains the same in GBD. But, still check this in the GBD dataset that you are using. If the mapping has changed, just make sure that you drop those `age_ids` that correspond to the following `age_names` listed earlier in this point.

```{r}
#> reading in the raw .csv file for mortality rates dataset from GBD for the year mentioned uptop in the "libGlobParameters" code chunk
mr_dataset_2019 <- read_csv("./data-raw/ihme_gbd_2019_mortality_rates_by_cause.csv")

#> drop certain columns and rename others to make them more intuitive

#> rename "cause_name" and "val" columns, arrange by (cause, age_id) and keep the following columns: age_id, age_name, cause_name, val.
mr_dataset_2019 <- mr_dataset_2019 %>%
    rename(cause = cause_name, 
         mortal_rate = val, 
         sex = sex_name) %>%
  select(age_id, age_name, cause, mortal_rate) %>%
  arrange(cause, age_id) 

#> filter out certain rows based on conditions mentioned above

# drop the following age_ids: 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 159, 162, 169

## drop age ids vector
drop_age_id_vec <- c(21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 159, 162, 169)
mr_dataset_2019 <- mr_dataset_2019 %>%
  filter(age_id %notin% drop_age_id_vec, 
         cause %notin% "All causes") 
  
  

```
